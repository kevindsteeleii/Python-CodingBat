Coding Practice for the Python

## About Coding Bat
CodingBat is a free site of live coding problems to build coding skill in Java and Python (example problem). CodingBat is a project by Nick Parlante, a computer science lecturer at Stanford.

Going through many practice problem is a great way to solidify your understanding of how the code should work. CodingBat problems work great as homework, or for self-study practice, or in a lab, or as live lecture examples. The CodingBat problems are designed to have low overhead: short problem statements (like an exam), nothing to install, immediate feedback in the browser, and there's lots of them to build up those skills. The idea for CodingBat came from my experience teaching CS at Stanford combined with seeing how student's used unit-tests in more advanced courses, and crystalized when I saw an Owen Astrachan demo of a unit-testing thing he uses with his Duke students.

## CodingBat Design Idea - Coding in the Large and Small
Every big programming problem has a lot of little programming problems in it. The little programming problems have elements we see again and again -- string and list manipulation, loops, a little logic.

Working with students in office hours, I see what a big advantage it is for students who are practiced and quick with these little bits of code. Skill with the little code allows students to concentrate on the larger parts of the problem. Or put another other way, someone who struggles with the loops, logic, etc. does not have time for the big picture.

CodingBat is all about building and practicing little code problems. The number of problems in each area is pretty large, so you can repeat and solidify your code skill in that area.
